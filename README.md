# CMPG323-Group-Project
Repository for our IT Developments group project.

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 16 or higher recommended)
- Git

## Installation & Setup
1. Clone the repository
Open your terminal, navigate to where you want to store the project, and run the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git
cd your-repository-name
```

2. Run the server

If you have not already installed dependecies, run

```bash
npm-modules.bat (Windows)
```
Do not run: npm audit fix --force, it just breaks the build.

If it is your first time running the project, run

```bash
npm build
```

Then run

```bash
npm start
```

The browser should open automatically at http://localhost:3000
