# How to test run

1. Run the server with

If you have not already installed dependecies, run

```bash
npm-modules.bat
```
Do not run: npm audit fix --force, it just breaks the build.

If it is your first time running the project, run

```bash
npm build
```

Then run

```bash
npm start
```

The browser should open automatically at http://localhost:3000

2. Run the backend with

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```
